# Step 1: Load the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv("/content/IRIS.csv")

# Assuming 'Class' column contains the labels and other columns are features

# Step 2: Split the data into features and labels
X = dataset.drop('Class', axis=1)

# Step 3: Split the data into training and testing sets

# Step 4: Feature Scaling

# Step 5: Train the KNN classifier

y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Step 7: Evaluate the accuracy of the model
